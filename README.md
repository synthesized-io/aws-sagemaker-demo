# Train, tune, and deploy a custom synthetic data generator using Synthesized's Tabular Data Generator Algorithm from AWS Marketplace

[Synthesized's Tabular Data Generator Algorithm]() brings the generative AI capabilitiies of our 
[SDK](https://docs.synthesized.io/sdk/latest/) to AWS Sagemaker.

## Overview

Our Scientific Data Kit (SDK) is a comprehensive framework for generative modelling for structured 
data. It helps you create compliant statistical-preserving data snapshots for BI/Analytics and 
ML/AI applications. Right-size your data with AI-supported data transformations.

You can find more details in our [documentation](https://docs.synthesized.io/sdk/latest/).

This demo repository shows you how to train a generative model for tabular data using 
[Synthesized's Tabular Data Generator Algorithm]() from AWS Marketplace.
